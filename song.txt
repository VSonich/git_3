Waiting for you
Nothing in this world can bring me
Peace and madness
They've become the very best of friends

Walking with you
Blindly follow out upon the
Water runs down
You've become the very best of friends

I'll live for you and try to be the king of fools
I'll long for you and walk before the king of all
